# Bioinfo_data_analysis_and_visualisations
Practical assignments and mini-projects in bioinformatics data analysis, turning raw biological data into meaningful insights.

This repository contains my coding assignments, projects, and experiments focused on data analysis and visualization in bioinformatics.
The goal is to explore how biological data — from genomics to proteomics — can be transformed into meaningful insights using computational tools.
